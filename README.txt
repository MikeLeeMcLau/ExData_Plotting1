This directory contains eight files.

4 files are sample graphs.

The 4 R files each contain two function.  All files contain the function DownLoadData() which is used to download the sample files.

The other functions are:

Plot1
Plot2
Plot3
Plot4

Each function was created by building on the previous function.   If the graph appeared to be correct, I did not go back and update the 
previous function as I want to have samples of what is requried with each set of data.
